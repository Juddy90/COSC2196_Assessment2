    "paragraph":"Our team has worked together reasonably well for our first assessment as a group. Most meetings were attended by all, and communication has not been poor however there is room for improvement. Work commitments, personal issues and sickness had minor impacts on our teams, but we were able to shuffle resources to ensure all tasks were completed. Ensuring assigned tasks are completed by agreed upon deadlines will set our team up for further success for future group assessments."

    "paragraph":"As a group, I believe we have performed alright. Most team members have attended all meetings, and any issues that were raised in the meetings were resolved as soon as possible. I think we could improve on meeting deadlines a bit more, as there were several items that were completed past their deadlines. I was surprised to learn how easy it was to use Microsoft TEAMs when collaborating and collating information."
