    "paragraph":"Our team has worked together reasonably well for our first assessment as a group. Most meetings were attended by all, and communication has not been poor however there is room for improvement. Work commitments, personal issues and sickness had minor impacts on our teams, but we were able to shuffle resources to ensure all tasks were completed. Ensuring assigned tasks are completed by agreed upon deadlines will set our team up for further success for future group assessments."
