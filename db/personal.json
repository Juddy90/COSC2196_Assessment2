    "My name is Zenithon Ho, but people call me Zen for short. Both my parents are from Hong Kong, but I was born in Australia. In my spare time, I play an online card game called Magic the Gathering: Arena, where I compete against other players whilst collecting cards. My interest in IT started when I was a very young age. The simple act of being connected to the world wide web and accessing information from our dial-up modem captivated me. Currently, I do not have much IT experience. My only knowledge of the languages are some small lessons done on websites such as freecodecamp.com and Codecademy. Through my studies at RMIT I would be expecting to learn how I would be integrating into the IT profession. Learning skills such as coding, working on projects, analysing and solving problems from the perspective of an IT professional. ",
